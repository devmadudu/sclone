# SClone

SClone is a Discord utility, used for cloning discord servers.

# IMPORTANT

⚠️**WARNING:** THIS IS AGAINST DISCORD'S ToS, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACCOUNT COMPROMISES FROM DISCORD!⚠️

## Notes

**1.** This utility won't copy channel and category permissions, because it isn't yet supported by the library for discord's API `discord.js`. Although it will copy everything else like the server icon, emojis, roles and role permissions, categories ect. And will order them accordingly to the server you want copied.

## Installation

Here's how to install **SClone**!

**Step 1:** Go to the **[releases](https://github.com/devmadudu/sclone/releases)** tab.

**Step 2:** Download the executable file from the latest version!

## Setup

After you download the executable, you must open it! After that a console window and a SClone window must pop-up!

## Usage

So, after you open the executable you'll see 3 text boxes (in the SClone window, not the console one). 

One of them prompts for your discord account token. Your token is used to perform automated actions in order to clone the server. **You can learn how to get your account's token [here](https://discordhelp.net/discord-token)**!

The second one prompts for the ID of the server you want to copy **(you must be in this server)**. You can learn how to get server ID's **[here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)**!

And the third and final prompt is for the ID of the server you want the copy server to be pasted/restored **(you must have `ADMINISTRATOR` permissions there)**. You can learn how to get server ID's **[here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)**!

Then finally if you have done everything right you should have a successfully cloned server!
